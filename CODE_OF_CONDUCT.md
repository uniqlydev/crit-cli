# Code of Conduct

## Purpose
A welcoming, safe, and inclusive community helps everyone build better software. This Code of Conduct defines expectations for all who participate in the `crit-cli` project (maintainers, contributors, users) and outlines steps for reporting and addressing misconduct.

## Our Standards
### Positive behaviors
- Showing empathy, kindness, and respect toward others
- Being open to constructive feedback and differing viewpoints
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project
- Using inclusive language and assuming good intent (while addressing harm)
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive reviews
- Crediting the work and ideas of others

### Unacceptable behaviors
- Harassment, discrimination, or intimidation in any form
- Derogatory, demeaning, or abusive language or imagery
- Personal attacks, insults, or stalking
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, deliberately spreading misinformation, or disrupting discussions
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information without explicit permission
- Persistent contact after a request to stop

## Scope
This Code applies in all project spaces (GitHub issues, PRs, discussions, docs, chats) and wherever you represent the project publicly. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:
1. Collect relevant context (links, screenshots, timestamps).
2. Email the maintainers at: **brencastillo@proton.me** (or open a confidential issue if enabled).
3. For urgent threats to safety, contact local authorities first.

Reports will be handled promptly, respectfully, and as confidentially as is reasonably possible. Retaliation for reporting in good faith is not tolerated.

## Enforcement Principles
We strive for:
- Consistency: Similar actions -> similar outcomes
- Proportionality: Consequences match the impact
- Restoration: Whenever possible, help participants re-engage constructively
- Transparency: Publicly document (in aggregate) enforcement actions when appropriate

## Enforcement Guidelines
The community leaders (maintainers) will use the following guidelines to determine the consequences of an action.

### 1. Correction
- **Impact:** Use of inappropriate language; minor rule violation
- **Consequence:** Private (or minimal) intervention with guidance for improvement

### 2. Warning
- **Impact:** A single significant violation or repetition after correction
- **Consequence:** Formal written warning; continued violations may escalate

### 3. Temporary Suspension
- **Impact:** Sustained disruptive behavior or harassment after warnings
- **Consequence:** Temporary exclusion from community spaces; terms and duration communicated

### 4. Permanent Ban
- **Impact:** Severe harassment; threats; repeated violations after suspension
- **Consequence:** Permanent removal from all community participation and representation

## Conflicts of Interest
If a report involves a maintainer, that maintainer will recuse themselves from enforcement decisions regarding that incident.

## Amendments
Project maintainers may update this Code to reflect community needs. Material changes will be communicated via the repository (e.g., CHANGELOG, release notes, or pinned issue).

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is an original synthesis inspired by widely adopted open-source codes of conduct (including the Contributor Covenant) without copying their protected text. The Contributor Covenant can be found at: https://www.contributor-covenant.org
